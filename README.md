Welcome! If you are here, you have BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Mod. This submod adds a few "small", cheap craft, historically used for convoy escort or colonial patrol purposes.

The Sloops and Advisos submod adds new ships starting around 1920 in the Torpedo Boat class, utilizing extremely cheap ships; good for navies on a budget, but perhaps not good in actual combat.

##This submod is a work in progress and is not complete yet. Here's what I need to do:
* Adjust balancing
* Add a few more hulls for some nations

This submod makes minor edits to your ships; I have tried to avoid making any changes that would affect base mod ships. As this submod is still a work in progress and balancing changes are to be expected, I do not recommend making shared designs for these ships at this time.

All versions of this submod will be saved and backed up here; however this submod was created when 3a13 was the current version and I will not be making versions for any DIP version older than this. You may freely use this in your own work. I appreciate credit but it is not necessary.

To use, simply download all of these files, then replace the mod's original files with matching names with these.

If you enjoy the submod, consider trying out my other submod for DIP: https://github.com/Omnisxiii2/HMaLSN-submod-for-DIP
